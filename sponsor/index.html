<h1 id="sponsor-jmonkeyengine">Sponsor jMonkeyEngine</h1>

<div class="ui info message">
  jMonkeyEngine is free! You are under no obligation to make any payment
  to use our engine. jMonkeyEngine is licensed under the very permissive BSD
  3-Clause License, giving you the freedom to publish your game and modify the
  engine without limitation completely free! There are no requirements to use our
  engine. No splash screens, no fees and no requirement to mention jMonkeyEngine
  in your game at all.
</div>

<p>jMonkeyEngine relies heavily on community sponsorship to maintain its online
presence and continually drive forward. Your sponsorship money pays the bills!
These include current and future server costs, engine improvements, online
services and all other future projects we are able to create via sponsorship.</p>

<p>We already have a <a href="https://jmonkeystore.com">Software Store</a> as a
result of the community funding. We currently only allow open-source software
on our store, but hope to allow buying and selling when our sponsorship allows
us to fund the legal advice and requirements to do so. This is one of our big
goals(!) and once available will be a fantastic addition for the engine to begin
to be able to support itself financially. With every sponsor we get closer!</p>

<p>Our future plans include a bug bounty system where talented developers can
squash stubborn bugs for a reward and a feature request system that may include
rewards for completing requests! We&rsquo;re hoping online services like these will
continue to push jMonkeyEngine forward, increasing its ability and popularity!</p>

<p>As well as improvements to the engine and online services, advertising, digital
media (professional logos, artwork, etc) are all part of the growth of any
entity, and sponsorship will also include improving these areas, too. We
understand the importance of getting our name out there!</p>

<p>There are several ways you can sponsor us, either monthly or a single one-time
payment. Please see below for the options we currently offer.</p>
