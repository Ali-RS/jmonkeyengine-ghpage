      <description>Introducing jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-beta2.
Today, engine leader Paul Speed successfully released jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-beta2, marking a new milestone in the advancement towards a stable release of jME3.3. Beta2 introduces many new bug fixes and features with a full list here https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.3.0-beta2. New game developers using jME should refrain themselves from using this release in production however. Current stable is v3.2.4 found on the github site. But one more time let&amp;rsquo;s give the core developers a big round of applause as we come ever closer a stable release.</description>
