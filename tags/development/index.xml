      <description>JMonkeyEngine version 3.3.2 is here!
After 3 months of beta testing, the Java game engine&amp;rsquo;s long-awaited v3.3 release arrived on 30 March. With it came exciting new features: AppState ids, light-probe blending, a better ragdoll control, and an animation system rewritten from the ground up.
As often happens, a few key bugfixes missed the cutoff for v3.3.0-stable. In its wake, the JMonkeyEngine team came together and identified a handful of existing fixes that could be safely backported into v3.</description>

      <description>Introducing jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-beta2.
Today, engine leader Paul Speed successfully released jMonkeyEngine 3.3.0-beta2, marking a new milestone in the advancement towards a stable release of jME3.3. Beta2 introduces many new bug fixes and features with a full list here https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.3.0-beta2. New game developers using jME should refrain themselves from using this release in production however. Current stable is v3.2.4 found on the github site. But one more time let&amp;rsquo;s give the core developers a big round of applause as we come ever closer a stable release.</description>
