      <description>Minie version 1.4 is an exciting new add-on for the JMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine.
  Minie provides an open-source physics engine for desktop games. It gives software developers using JME access to the proven technology of the Bullet Physics SDK version 2.89, including:
 rigid-body dynamics, soft bodies, collision detection, vehicle and character controllers, ray and sweep tests, and dynamic constraints.  Minie incorporates DynamicAnimControl technology for ragdoll simulation and inverse kinematics.</description>

      <description>After years of requests and attempts, a software store (a.k.a an asset store) for jmonkey has finally been created and is now open to registration. Everybody can register and submit their software!
https://jmonkeystore.com/  Currently only free open-source software can be submitted. Once we have the sponsorship required for the legal documentation and setup fees we will be able to allow selling (payment required to use it) and sponsoring (pay the developer if you want to as a thank you) software.</description>
