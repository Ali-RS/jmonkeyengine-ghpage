      <description>Sgold:
Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.
First question: When did you first hear about JMonkeyEngine?
   Jayfella:
Way back in 2014, after a long period of developing desktop applications, servers, and minecraft plugins, I decided to look into writing games. At that time I was more into C#, but XNA was a sinking ship, so looked at alternatives. I found jMonkey and gave it a shot.</description>
