      <description>Skullstone – a retro styled grid-based dungeon crawler RPG inspired by the good old titles such as Dungeon Master, Stonekeep, Eye of Beholder and many other classics.
In a few words – a party of mercenaries explore a dungeon. They fight monsters, solve puzzles, find equipment, gather experience and level up while progressing through increasingly difficult levels. And there’s a story behind all that, are you ready to discover the truth behind Skullstone ?</description>
