      <description>Sgold:
Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.
First question: When did you first hear about JMonkeyEngine?
   Jayfella:
Way back in 2014, after a long period of developing desktop applications, servers, and minecraft plugins, I decided to look into writing games. At that time I was more into C#, but XNA was a sinking ship, so looked at alternatives. I found jMonkey and gave it a shot.</description>

      <description>Minie version 1.4 is an exciting new add-on for the JMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine.
  Minie provides an open-source physics engine for desktop games. It gives software developers using JME access to the proven technology of the Bullet Physics SDK version 2.89, including:
 rigid-body dynamics, soft bodies, collision detection, vehicle and character controllers, ray and sweep tests, and dynamic constraints.  Minie incorporates DynamicAnimControl technology for ragdoll simulation and inverse kinematics.</description>
